# 🎨 From Designer to Full-Stack Developer: My Code Journey 🚀

Welcome to my code lab! I'm [Mariu], an aspiring full-stack developer fresh out of an intensive bootcamp, bringing a **decade of experience in the captivating world of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design**. For years, my mission was to shape intuitive and visually appealing digital products.

Now, I've made the leap into full-stack development, diving deep into building those experiences from their foundations. My past as a designer isn't just a differentiator; it's a competitive edge. I approach every line of code with a profound understanding of user needs and the critical importance of impeccable design.

I'm here to build solutions that are robust, scalable, and, most importantly, **people-centered**. ✨
